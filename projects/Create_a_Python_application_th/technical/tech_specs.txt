**Technical Specification for Real-Time Bitcoin Price Tracker**

1. **Programming Language and Environment**
   - **Python**: The application will be developed using Python due to its extensive libraries and ease of handling APIs and data.

2. **Libraries and Tools**
   - **requests**: For making HTTP requests to the public API to fetch Bitcoin prices.
   - **pandas**: To handle and manipulate data, particularly useful for creating and appending data to CSV files.
   - **time**: To manage scheduled tasks, ensuring the script runs every minute.
   - **logging**: To implement error logging and monitor application status.
   - **schedule** (optional): For more advanced task scheduling and management.

3. **Public API Options**
   - **CoinGecko API**: A reliable and free API to fetch the current Bitcoin price.
   - **Binance API**: Another option that provides real-time cryptocurrency data, suitable for more advanced features.

4. **Components and Functions**
   - **API Integration**: 
     - Use the `requests` library to connect to the chosen API.
     - Implement JSON parsing to extract Bitcoin price data.
     - Handle API errors and rate limits with retries and logging.
   - **Data Storage**:
     - Use `pandas` to structure data with timestamps.
     - Save or append data to a CSV file every minute, ensuring data consistency.
     - Handle file access conflicts with appropriate file locks or checks.
   - **Real-Time Monitoring**:
     - Calculate percentage change in Bitcoin price.
     - Compare current price with the last recorded price from the CSV file.
     - Print a warning if the change exceeds 1%.
   - **Testing and Optimization**:
     - Test the script for various scenarios, including network issues.
     - Optimize API calls and ensure data freshness with minimal resource usage.
     - Implement logging for application monitoring and alert tracking.
   - **Deployment**:
     - Schedule the script to run continuously using a task scheduler or as a daemon.
     - Document setup, usage instructions, and troubleshooting steps.

By leveraging these libraries and APIs, the Python application will efficiently track real-time Bitcoin prices, store data reliably, and alert users to significant market movements, ensuring a comprehensive solution for monitoring cryptocurrency trends.
