Thought: I need to address the syntax error in the Python file. The error is due to an unterminated string literal, which suggests that there is a documentation section that is not properly formatted. I will read the file's content again to identify the exact location of the issue and then provide a corrected version without the problematic documentation.
Action: Read a file's content
Action Input: {"file_path":"./projects/Simple_Calculator_CLI/source_code/main.py","start_line":1,"line_count":50}
